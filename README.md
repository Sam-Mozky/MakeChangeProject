# Project Discription
The overall goal of this project was to create a program in which the user is prompted to input the cost of the item as well as the money given to pay that item. The program then takes those two numbers and prints out whether it was exact and no payment was needed, not enough money was provided to pay for the item, or the amount of change due.

# Lessons learned
Some things I've learner during this project is the importance of breaks. A lot of the time I try to just sit down, and don't get up until it's done. Although, there were a couple times where I just couldn't think of where to start, so I got up, made some tea, cleaned up my space and tried again. I was surprised at the results.
